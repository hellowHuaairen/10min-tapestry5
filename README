This is a simple application created in about 10 minutes that shows how to
use Tapestry 5 to create a very basic web application along the lines of
Reddit, Digg or Hacker News.  It lets users add links and vote up the ones
they find interesting.

It was created as a demonstration and is not at all something you want to run
in production, but it should give you a very good idea of what programming
using the Tapestry framework is like.
